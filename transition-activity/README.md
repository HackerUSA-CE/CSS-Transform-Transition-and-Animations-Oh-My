# Transition Activity

## Getting Started

- open `index.html` in your text editor and the browser
- open `activity.css` in your text editor

## Using transform

Add a transform rule to the `button` element in `activity.css`

So that you can slowly change the button background color to `cornflowerblue` and the text to `ghostwhite` over 2 seconds when you hover your pointer over the button.

### Bonus
- Add more styling to the button - whatever you want to make it look better

### Super Bonus!

Use the following resource and refactor (feel free to change the html and css, as needed - but try to apply the solution to the code that is there, don't just copy paste the code in the demo) the code so that the caption title and text overlays the image like in the following:
